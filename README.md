# Obsidian Shiki Plugin

This plugin integrates [shiki](https://shiki.style/) via [Expressive Code](https://expressive-code.com/) into Obsidian, providing better syntax highlighting for over 100 languages.

This plugin works in reading mode and in live preview mode, as long as your cursor is not inside the code block.

Below is an example with line numbers, a custom header, and line highlighting.
